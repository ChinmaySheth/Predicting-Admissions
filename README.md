# Predicting-Admissions

## Introduction

In this exercise, I'm analyzing a university dataset which contains information about student admissions. I am hoping to build a generalized linear model in order to reliably predict a student's admission to the university using SAS.

## Dataset

The dataset that I am using was obtained from Kaggle and it contains data on university admission data. The dataset contains the following columns:

1. Serial No.
2. GRE Score
3. TOEFL Score
4. University Rating
5. SOP
6. LOR
7. CGPA
8. Research
9. Chance of Admit

The dataset contains 400 entries with no data missing.
